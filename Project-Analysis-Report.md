## ðŸš€ Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Complete TypeScript migration
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states
   - Set up testing infrastructure

2. **Core Feature Additions**
   - Ad editing functionality
   - Favoriting system
   - Advanced search

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive improvements
   - Empty states
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Administration**

## Technical Debt Analysis
1. **Security**
   - Need proper input sanitization
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Session management review

2. **Code Organization**
   - Some component organization could be improved
   - Utility functions need better organization
   - Could benefit from feature-based structure

3. **Documentation**
   - Need proper API documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Setup instructions
